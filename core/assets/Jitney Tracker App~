Jitney Tracker App~


-Registered Bus Drivers can use this to send gps data via network to a server.
-Network data will be sent to registered users.
-Will only be available to users in our country/area
-Will require me to program a server


-Should also be able to turn off GPS tracking when going on lunch or closing their service for the day. (since we are tracking them by phone) This being the case, the app should be made easy to switch on and off (so simple and idiot can do it blinded).

-The app will allow the user to select their desired route. Once selected a gps map will appear with the highlighted route with the jitney's represented by their route number in a small circle.

-The user should be able to see who is driving which bus. For obvious personal/safety reasons (Some persons are select in their jitney choices for)



Problem
1. User registration
2. Public privacy/saftey
3. Privacy/Saftey of the drivers

Pros-
Allows those with the apps to plan their travel in advance without having to miss the bus.
(since no one organization governs jitney scheduling everything just happens in tandem)

Cons-
Frequently updating GPS data will lower phone battery life.
Adoption rate is a concern since bahamians are not apt to new things. (unless its instant gratification)
Will need a system to replace which phone is registered in case the phone is lost/stolen. (Something very user friendly)
